A **Reverse Proxy** is a server or service that sits between client devices and a web server, forwarding client requests to the web server and returning the server's responses back to the clients. Unlike a forward proxy, which handles requests on behalf of clients seeking resources from the internet, a reverse proxy manages requests on behalf of servers.
